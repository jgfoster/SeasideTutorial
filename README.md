# Learning Web Development with Seaside

Seaside is a free, open-source (MIT License) web application development framework written in Smalltalk. It originated in Squeak, a free, open-source implementation of Smalltalk, and has been ported to other dialects of Smalltalk, including commercial dialects from Cincom and GemStone. In this tutorial you will develop a Seaside application and understand how the framework addresses the various web architecture challenges.

As a junior-high student in 1971, James Foster discovered the local university's computer lab and learned Basic, Fortran, and assembly. After trying other careers (commercial aviation and law), he returned to computer programming and was introduced to Object Oriented Programming on the Macintosh in the 1980s. Since then James has worked on large system (primarily in healthcare) and introduced agile practices to the teams he has lead. James has presented at OOPSLA and other technical conferences. James Foster spent 12 years on the Smalltalk Engineering Team for GemStone/S and is an evangelist for the Seaside web framework. He teaches Computer Science at Walla Walla University.
